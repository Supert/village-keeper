It is repository of mobile game Village Keeper ([GooglePlay page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZinovyGames.VillageKeeper))


Little about myself: my name is Alexey Korolev and I am C# developer. I was engaged in a number of startups for last two years. Thing is, all of them had failed by different reasons. So, I had about one and half year of expirience in Xamarin and Unity3D technologies but had no finished projects to proof it. So I found artist, came up with concept and made this game. Unfortunately, I ran out of money in process and can't really promote it. I would say, it is another failed project, but it is finished one. I am happy to put it in my portfolio.

### How do I get set up? ###

NB: This section will be updated as I clean up repository from 3-rd party code and other stuff.

Repo is pretty messy right now, I was just commiting pretty much everything in project folder. Wrong usage, I know.

All you need to launch it is up-to-date Unity3D and Android SDK. All my stuff located in Assets/VillageKeeper folder.

### Licensing terms ###
