It is repository of mobile game Village Keeper ([GooglePlay page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZinovyGames.VillageKeeper))


Little about myself: my name is Alexey Korolev and I am C# developer. I was engaged in a number of startups for last two years. Thing is, all of them had failed by different reasons. So, I had about one and half year of expirience in Xamarin and Unity3D technologies but had no finished projects to proof it. So I found artist, came up with concept and made this game. Unfortunately, I ran out of money in process and can't really promote it. I would say, it is another failed project, but it is finished one. I am happy to put it in my portfolio.

### How do I get set up? ###

Repo is pretty messy right now, I was just commiting pretty much everything in project folder. Wrong usage, I know.

You need up-to-date Unity3D and Android SDK. 

Also, you need to add to project Soomla In-App Purchase, GoogleMobileAds and APathfinderByDeenGames. You can find links to it below. Simply follow up their instructions. 

Please note that Soomla and GoogleMobileAds conflict with each other. To resolve it, remove in-app-billing-service-aidl.jar from GoogleMobileAds folder.

All my stuff located in Assets/VillageKeeper folder.

### Licensing terms ###

Please, read this if you want to use something from these repo in your project. I tried to keep this section human-friendly and short.
